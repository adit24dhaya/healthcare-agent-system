# AWS Deployment

The deployment target is AWS App Runner running two Dockerized services:

- FastAPI inference API
- Next.js healthcare risk console

This keeps the production path small enough to maintain while still showing a real cloud
stack: Docker, ECR, managed HTTPS, health checks, Terraform, and token-protected APIs.

## Deployment Flow

1. Train the model on Kaggle.
2. Download `risk_model.joblib` into `artifacts/`.
3. Create the ECR repositories with Terraform.
4. Build the API and web Docker images.
5. Push both images to ECR.
6. Deploy both App Runner services with Terraform from `infra/aws/apprunner`.

## Runtime Contract

The container expects:

- `MODEL_ARTIFACT_PATH=/app/artifacts/risk_model.joblib`
- `REQUIRE_API_TOKEN=true`
- `API_TOKEN=<strong-token>`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY=<optional-key>`

The Next.js container expects:

- `API_BASE_URL=https://<api-service-url>`
- `API_TOKEN=<same-token-used-by-api>`

If the model artifact is not present, the service starts with the local demo CSV model.
For the portfolio deployment, include the Kaggle artifact in the image before pushing
to ECR.

## API Checks

```bash
curl -s https://<service-url>/health
curl -s https://<service-url>/v1/predict/summary \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"age":52,"height_cm":170,"weight_kg":88,"bp":142,"glucose":160}'
```

## Web Check

Open the App Runner web service URL and run a patient assessment from the browser.
The browser calls the Next.js `/api/predict` route, and that server-side route forwards
to the protected FastAPI `/v1/predict` endpoint.

## Portfolio Talking Points

- reproducible Kaggle training
- persisted model artifact with metrics and model card
- FastAPI inference service
- Next.js production risk console
- Streamlit decision dashboard as a local fallback
- retrieval, memory, safety checks, and explainability
- Dockerized deployment to AWS App Runner with Terraform
